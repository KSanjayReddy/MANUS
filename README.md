# MANUS
The USB Mouse controlled Robotic Arm using Arduino and Processing.
We are trying to build a low cost Robotic Arm with 6 degrees of freedom using 6 servo motors . The design was made using Autodesk and for the prototype we are using ply as the body , and later we will use Acrylic for the body. The cost will be around 10000 INR. For the first part of our project we are controlling the ARM with a usb mouse. For this purpose we are using Arduino and Processing . Later we will develop a Human Hand imitating ARM using kinect sensor and Machine Learning.

We will also develop a SOftware kit that can be used by anyone to build their own Robotic Arm. They can cus
